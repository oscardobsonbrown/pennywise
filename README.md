# TaxUI

TaxUI helps you understand your tax returns in a beautiful interface with clean tables and structured content. You can also chat with your tax history to get advice or find insights in your historical returns.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Bun

TaxUI runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh), a fast JavaScript runtime.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Get an Anthropic API Key

TaxUI uses Claude to parse and analyze your tax returns. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

### 3. Run TaxUI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianlovin/tax-ui
cd tax-ui
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Upload** your tax return PDFs (upload a single PDF per year)
2. **Review** parsed income, deductions, and tax breakdowns
3. **Chat** with Claude to understand your tax situation

## Privacy & Security

### How Your Data is Processed

Your tax data is processed locally and sent directly to Anthropic's API using your own API key. No data is stored on any third-party servers.

- Tax return PDFs are sent to Anthropic's API for parsing
- Parsed data is stored only on your local machine
- Your API key stays on your computer and is never transmitted elsewhere

Anthropic's commercial terms prohibit training models on API customer data. See [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy).

### Verify It Yourself

TaxUI is open source. You can review the code yourself, or ask an AI to audit it for you. Copy the prompt below and paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, or any other AI assistant:

```
I want you to perform a security and privacy audit of TaxUI, an open source tax return parser.

Repository: https://github.com/brianlovin/tax-ui

Please analyze the source code and verify:

1. DATA HANDLING
   - Tax return PDFs are sent directly to Anthropic's API for parsing
   - No data is sent to any other third-party servers
   - Parsed data is stored locally only

2. NETWORK ACTIVITY
   - Identify all network requests in the codebase
   - Verify the only external calls are to Anthropic's API
   - Check for any hidden data collection or tracking

3. API KEY SECURITY
   - Verify API keys are stored locally and not transmitted elsewhere
   - Check that keys are not logged or exposed

4. CODE INTEGRITY
   - Look for obfuscated or suspicious code
   - Review dependencies for anything concerning

Key files to review:
- src/index.ts (Bun server and API routes)
- src/lib/parser.ts (Claude API integration)
- src/lib/storage.ts (Local file storage)
- src/App.tsx (React frontend)

Report any privacy or security concerns. I'm considering using this app with sensitive tax data.
